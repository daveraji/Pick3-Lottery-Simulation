# Pick3-Lottery-Simulation
I wanted to learn more about Pick3. It's the lottery with the best winning odds in my region. For the box draw, the game is simple every round a random 3 digit number is generated and you choose 3 numbers to enter. If your numbers match the drawn number in ANY order then you win a prize that is dependant on how many other people won. 
- I created some code to simulate how often you would win the Box contest for a pick3 lottery on any given day. 
- I then made a longer simulation to help understand what an expected value of return would be if you played consistently long-term.
- Finally, I downloaded all the winning numbers from the website and plotted the recent 1000 to see if there was a trend of more frequently occurring numbers.
