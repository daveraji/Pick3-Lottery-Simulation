# Pick3-Lottery-Simulation
I wanted to learn more about playing the highest odds lottery in my region. I created some code to simulate how often you would win the Box contest for a pick3 lottery. I then made a larger simulation to help understand what an expected value of return would be if you played consistently long-term. Finally, I downloaded all the winning numbers from the website and plotted the recent 1000 to see if there was a trend of more frequently occurring numbers.
